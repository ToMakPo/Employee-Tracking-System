  "description": "Steve has a small business.  He hires part-time workers to cover the front desk.  He needs a system to keep track of his workers (current and past), the hours they are scheduled to work each week, the weekly paycheck / pay statement with taxes deducted that each employee is due.  He needs to ensure that no employee works more than 25 hours / week.  He needs an interface to enter employees and their schedule for a week.  He needs to generate their pay statements weekly also.  Heâ€™d also like to understand who is working the most and least hours along with how many sick days an employee has taken.",
